						You already know about some ways of producing energy. If not, then you should probably watch our video on that topic <a href="producing.html">click here to watch producing video</a>. But why do we even need to store energy? Can’t we just make as much as we need? It turns out we cannot for different reasons. You can probably guess why solar plants can’t operate whenever we want them to – sunlight can’t reach them when its dark or cloudy outside. The same goes for wind turbines – the wind just doesn’t blow constantly. And since we may need energy at times when we don’t have the ability to produce it, we store some in advance.
						<br>
						<br>
						When most people hear energy storage, they think of batteries. And they are widely used on a smaller scale, for example, the small rechargeable batteries you use in your TV remote. Supercapacitors sound similar to batteries as they both rely on chemical principles to store electricity, but supercapacitors offer significantly shorter charge and discharge times and tolerate hundreds of times more charge-discharge cycles that batteries and have a longer lifespan. They are used in electric cars, buses and even trains. But electrochemical systems have a big disadvantage – they are expensive to produce and have a low energy density.
						<br>
						<br>
						Another method of storing energy is the flywheel. Flywheel energy storage systems work by accelerating a rotor (the flywheel) to a very high rotational speed to store the energy and decelerating it to release it. In most cases, this is achieved by using an electric motor setup where the motor used to spin the flywheel up also acts as a generator. The more advanced systems use magnetic bearings and a vacuum enclosure, spinning up to 50000 rotations per minute. Some advantages of flywheel storage systems are:
						<br>
						<br>
						-They have a long lifetime
						<br>
						<br>
						-They have a high energy efficiency which means that they can restore most of the energy that went into them
						<br>
						<br>
						-They require very little maintenance
						<br>
						<br>
						All of these systems have one common disadvantage – they are not very practical for large-scale applications. The solution to that problem comes in the form of pumped hydroelectric storage. Well, what is it? This method stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy by pumping water from a lower reservoir into a higher one. To accomplish this, surplus electricity is used which comes at a low cost. Then when the demand for power is high, the water is released through turbines to produce electricity like in a traditional hydroelectric power plant. Pumped hydroelectric storage provides the largest storage capacity of all methods currently available and is really cost-effective. The biggest disadvantage of such systems is the very specific geographical requirements for terrain height and water availability. Sometimes, to overcome this issue, both the upper and the lower reservoir are man-made. These power plants are referred to as closed-loop systems. There is a variation of this system which uses a conventional hydroelectric power plant and has a pump-back facility to pump water back into the dam. The result is a hybrid system in which the upper reservoir has both a natural water inflow and an artificial one.
