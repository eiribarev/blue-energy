						HPP stands for Hydroelectric Power Plant.
						It uses water from a dam to rotate a turbine with a coupled electric generator driven by the passing water.
						Small hydroelectric power plants do not need pre-accumulated water, which makes them more environmentally friendly.
						HPPs are considered one of the safest ways of producing energy. <br> <br>

						A wind turbine is a device that converts the kinetic energy from the movement of air masses above the earth into electricity.
						There are two types based on their axis of rotation â€“ vertical or horizontal axis wind turbines (VAWT and HAWT).
						VAWTs are more quiet, economical, easy to maintain and operate at a lower wind speed while HAWTs can produce more energy. <br> <br>

						The turbine is a rotary engine that extracts energy from the motion of fluid or gasses.
						Hydroelectric power plants use water turbines that are driven by water pressure, wind turbines use the power of the wind and steam turbines use steam pressure.
						All power plants that burn fuel (coal, oil, natural gas) as well as nuclear and mirror solar plants generate electricity by heating up water (thus turning it into steam) and driving turbines with it.
