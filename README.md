# Blue Energy
We are *The Band of Ocean* and this is our project about Blue Energy.

---
Our modern society has a large need of energy in the form of electricity. We use it in our everyday lives as well as to power our industries. But where does that electricity come from? How does it get stored until just the right time for us to use it? How does it get to us?

Our goal is to provide the answers to those questions in an interesting and engaging way.

The project consists of a website and a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsdJwPfE_WNU0kvqo3O6XCg). The website has been deployed for testing on GitHub Pages [here](https://eiribarev.github.io/blue-energy).
