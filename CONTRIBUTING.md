# Contribution Guidelines

In this file you can find all the rules about contributing to the project.

This guide assumes that you are using *git* through the command-line although there are some GUI alternatives which you are free to use instead.

If you have any questions, you can contact me at my [school email](mailto:eiribarev@codingburgas.bg).

## Writing code

You can use whichever text editor you prefer as long as it has support for a **.editorconfig** file. You can see a full list of the supported editors at the [EditorConfig project](https://editorconfig.org)'s page.

***Note**: Please do not forget to install the appropriate plugin if your editor of choice requires one.*

### HTML Conventions

Below are some rules you should follow when editing HTML code.

- All child elements should be indented.
- Empty lines should be placed between elements of the same level which have different meanings.

Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
	<head>
		<title>Title</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h1>A heading</h1>
		<p>
			A paragraph.
		</p>
		<p>
			A second paragraph connected to the first one.
		</p>

		<h1>A second heading</h1>
		<p>
			A completely different paragraph.
		</p>
	</body>
</html>
```
instead of
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>A heading</h1>
<p>
A paragraph.
</p>
<p>
A second paragraph connected to the first one.
</p>
<h1>A second heading</h1>
<p>
A completely different paragraph.
</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### CSS Conventions
Below are some rules you should follow when editing CSS code. The CSS code **MUST** be seperated into external files!

- There should be a space between any CSS selector and the opening bracket.
- The closing bracket shoould be on a new line.
- A `;` should be put after **every** line of code
- There should be a space between the `:` after the property name and its value

Example:
```css
p {
	margin: 0px;
	color: #ff0000;
}
```
instead of
```css
p{
margin:0px;
color:#ff0000}
```

## Working with *git*

***Important**: If you don't know how to work with *git* from the command line, it is recommended that you find and use a GUI client instead.*

To make changes to the project you will need to download and install [git](https://git-scm.com) if you haven't done so already. If you need help, there are many guides online which cover the process.

After you have *git* installed on your system, you need to clone the repository by navigating to the parent directory in which you want the repository to be stored on your system and running `git clone`.

When you are ready to start work, open a new branch by running `git branch` and `git checkout`. Commit your changes often and in an orderly manner and write meaningful commit messages. When you are ready to share your changes, run `git pull` and then `git push`. When you think that the changes in your branch are ready to be merged into the *master* branch, open a *pull request*.

***Important**: **Always** run `git pull` before `git push`!*

For every operation you wish to do on the remote repository (`git clone`, `git pull`, `git push` etc.) you will probably be asked to provide your *GitHub* login credentials.

## Working with *GitHub Issues*

*Issues* are used for tracking different tasks like bugs to fix or features to add.

Each issue has an *assignee* â€“ a person assigned to work on it.

An issue can have an unlimited ammount of *labels* which can help when organising different types of issues.

---
In our project we're going to use issues to help us split the work between ourselves.

Before making any changes, make sure there is an issue open for those changes and if there isn't, open one. When a new issue is opened, we will discuss what has to be done and who has to do it using the built-in *comments*.
